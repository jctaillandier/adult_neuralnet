### Neural net implementation for Adult dataset

<ul>
    <li> Adult is a 48 000 examples binary classification dataset</li>
    <li> Contains 14 features, 7 of which categoricals</li>
    <li> Very imbalanced dataset (75% - 25%)</li>
    <li>  </li>
</ul>
<p> Although Random Forests have been known to be very efficient on this dataset<br>
I tried to find ways to reach the 90% accuracy bar, which seemed difficult</p>

<p> Very easy to adjust the code and do any architecture you want</p>

<p> Contains routine to load data from csv and re organize them in order to be used with pytorch's dataloader</p>

<p> Next interesting step would be to normalize non-categorical variables</p>
